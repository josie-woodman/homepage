# What I Have Been Trying To Do

I was trying to create a parallax scroll effect on the header image on the home page located in "images/men-bonding.png" <br>
following the same format as the About Page. 

# Quick Links Section

I wanted to have three squares evenly spaced out with the Quick Links like in the Wireframe, but my code wasn't cooperating <br>
with the Bootstrap code that was already there. 

# Mission Statement

I have created the raw Mission Statement code, it just needs the Bootstrap styles applied to it.

# Contact Form
I have the raw Form coded, but it is not styled to match the theme of the website, and the changes I had made to it did not <br>
work because of the Bootstrap issue.
